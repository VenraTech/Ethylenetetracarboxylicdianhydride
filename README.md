# Ethylenetetracarboxylicdianhydride
3 payload GDI Malware that disables Task Manager. I am not responsible for any issues!

# ❤️ For skidders
I know that some people will skid some effects after I release the source code to put in their malwares, and even if I complain about it, nothing will change...

So for that reason I added a GPLv3 license. In other words, if you use/modify a part of my code, you need to make your project open source and give me credit!
